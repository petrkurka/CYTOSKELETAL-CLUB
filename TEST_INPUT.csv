Using a pulsed laser we ablated several microtubules and found no impact on centrosome position. We then generated asters with short microtubules unable to reach cell periphery and found no impact on aster centering. Finally, we artificially off-centered the asters and found that they were unable to go back to the center by microtubule growth. Instead, we found that acts-myosin contractility was key to position the aster. We will propose a new mechanism for centrosome positioning and the regulation of cell polarity.","ERC","1","1","Manuel Thery","CEA","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GMT+3","ondrej.kucera@biophysics.cz","The Anillin Link: Uncovering a Contractile Microtubule-Actin Crosstalk","Cytoskeletal crosstalk, particularly between microtubules and actin filaments, is essential for coordinating cellular events. In this talk, we present our recent in vitro discovery of a novel interaction mediated by the protein anillin, which acts as a crucial link between microtubules and actin filaments. We demonstrate that anillin not only mediates the interaction between these two cytoskeletal components but also promotes contractile forces in actin-microtubule systems.

Understanding how this diversity has arisen requires an understanding of animal shape evolution. Animals acquire their shape during a developmental process called “morphogenesis”, which is driven by forces that are generated in the actomyosin cell cortex of embryonic cells. Despite the mechanical nature of morphogenesis, its evolution has long been researched from a genetics point of view. Here, we aim to investigate the processes underlying animal shape diversification, with a specific focus on unravelling the mechanisms governing the evolution of early nematode morphogenesis, from a mechanical perspective. To this end, we perform a comparative approach to classify and characterize early embryo morphogenesis across the nematode phylum. Additionally, we will employ the strength of experimental evolution (EE) to investigate how morphogenesis adapts in response to natural selection. Our primary objective is to gain insights into how the physical force-generating mechanisms underlying morphogenesis evolve. Through our research, we aim to contribute to our understanding of evolution, shape diversity and the (bio)physical mechanisms driving the remarkable animal shape diversity we see today.","Lumina quaeruntur grant of the Czech Academy of Science","1","1","Sjak van Grootel","Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent in vitro results show CKAP5 as a crosslinker of actin filaments, bundling them between each other and connecting them to the microtubules. The interplay between actin and microtubules influences growth and steering of the axons of human neurons, possibly by selecting the path for microtubule polymerisation.

Reorganization of highly dynamic microtubules (MTs) and microfilaments is central to these processes. γ-Tubulin ring complexes are important regulators of centrosomal MT nucleation and organization. We found that in addition to the known γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs), γ-tubulin interacts with the signaling adaptor protein GIT2 in bone marrow mast cells (BMMCs). GIT2 associates with isolated centrosomes, and tagged GIT2 labels BMMCs centrosomes.  Depletion of GIT2 results in significant changes in MT nucleation from centrosomes, total MT mass, and cell morphology. GIT2 also affects degranulation of activated cells and chemotaxis to antigen.

GMT+3","petra.novotna@img.cas.cz","Could Mechanical Stress Drive DNA Damage and Carcinogenesis?","Colorectal carcinoma is the most frequent cancer with a higher propensity among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. One of the hallmarks of cancer observed in the majority of IBD-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) is chromosomal instability. The possible link between cancer progression and mechanical stress seems obvious but has not been intensively addressed so far. In this study, we use plectin as a tool that enables us to manipulate the mechanical stability of individual cells. 
Plectin, a large cytolinker from the plakin protein family, physically crosslinks individual intermediate filaments (IFs), links them to other cytoskeletal components, and further anchors to desmosome/hemidesmosome structures at the cell periphery. On the other site, plectin anchors the IFs mesh to the nuclear envelope. This arrangement of cytoskeletal structures facilitates the formation of dynamic meshwork throughout the whole cell providing the potential to absorb mechanical forces acting on the cell and protect the cell nucleus and genome. To study the importance of plectin in mechanical stability, we generated a mouse model lacking plectin, specifically in the intestinal epithelium (PleΔIEC). For in vitro study, we generated plectin-deficient cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and exposed them to mechanical stress. In this study, we show that PleΔIEC mice spontaneously develop colorectal cancer, and further analysis of p-gH2AX foci in PleΔIEC mice revealed higher susceptibility to DNA damage. In vitro, plectin deletion causes aberrant organization of IFs associated with delayed cellular adaptation to mechanical stress. The mechanical challenge we exposed to the cells helped us reveal higher deformability and increased DNA damage of plectin KO cells leading to chromosomal instability within the cellular population. Finally, we demonstrate that mechanically-induced DNA damage increases the tumorigenic potential of Ple KO cells. 
Taken together, we demonstrate the importance of plectin in the mechanical integrity of cells that help to protect against DNA damage and subsequent carcinogenesis in highly mechanically challenged tissues.

Physical linkage of cytoskeletal components is mediated by cytoskeletal linker proteins (cytolinkers) of the plakin protein family. Plectin, a prototypical ubiquitously expressed cytolinker, not only crosslinks intermediate filaments (and other networks) but also anchors them at junctional complexes, balances internal tension and stabilizes cellular structures, thus maintaining cell integrity. Over past years, plectin was found to be upregulated in various tumor types. Consistently, our results show plectin upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and in HCC-derived cell lines, where its expression correlates with the cell motility and invasion. For this reason, we decided to employ plectin targeting to 1) study the role of plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk in migratory and tumorigenic potential of HCC cells and to 2) validate plectin as potential target for HCC treatment.
Thus, we generated plectin-deficient (KO) HCC cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 approach together with plectin functional mutants lacking IF-binding domain (ΔIFBD). In parallel, we addressed the effect of plectin pharmacological targeting using plecstatin, a high affinity function-modulating plectin‘s ligand. To explore the effect of plectin targeting on tumor progression, we studied the tumor growth of HCC-derived xenografts in immunocompromised mice and in vitro colony formation using soft agar colony formation assay. Mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics identified response signatures of both genetic and pharmacological plectin targeting in HCC cells, showing the effect on signaling pathways crucial for cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, polarity, and motility. Next, we observed aberrant actin stress fiber architecture and collapsed vimentin IF network using immunofluorescence microscopy. In line with observed phenotypes, traction force microscopy determined altered contractile energy in plectin-targeted cells. These changes were reflected in the migration potential of HCC cells upon plectin inactivation. These findings were confirmed in vivo using a lung colonization assay. Together, our results demonstrate the importance of plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk in HCC cell migration and tumorigenicity.","This work was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (GA21-21736S) and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (ID Project No. LX22NPO5102 - Funded by the European Union - Next Generation EU).","More than 10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(1) Laboratory of Integrative Biology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic

Canonically, non-muscle myosin II is responsible for force generation within contractile networks. Recent evidence hints that the contractility, in part, is driven by other than myosin generated forces. For example previous work described mode of motor-independent contractility based on actin crosslinker diffusion. How crosslinker generated contractility is modulated is largely unknown. Here we show that actin severing factors enhance crosslinker-driven network contractility. Addition of severing factors to anillin-bundled actin ring-like structures triggered contraction and promoted morphological changes of these networks. These results provide an insight into the regulation mechanism of crosslinker driven contraction within complex actin networks.","","1","2","","","","Roman Podhájecký","Institute of Biotechnology, CAS","Charles University, Faculty of Science","Yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cells undergo significant morphological changes in the process which are dependent on regulated cytoskeletal rearrangements. Hence, multiple cytoskeleton-associated proteins regulate the cytoskeleton networks based on specific intrinsic and external cues. We focus on an actin-binding protein called anillin. Anillin canonically scaffolds the cytokinetic ring where it stabilizes and strengthens actomyosin contraction. However, anillin has never been observed in human neural cells before. Our model is a cell line of NPCs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells expressing endogenous mNG-anillin. We have discovered that anillin accumulates at sites of tension within the cells such as stress fibers or leading and trailing ends of migrating cells. Immunofluorescence has revealed that the anillin spots localize to the center of actomyosin structures. Interestingly, the anillin spots are not present in all actomyosin structures in cells but the presence of anillin correlates with higher levels of activated non-muscle myosin II. We use collagen fiber displacement microscopy to show that cells expressing higher levels of anillin exert higher forces on collagen gels, indicating that their contractility is indeed increased. We hypothesize that anillin is needed in a specific context to strengthen actomyosin contraction in NPCs. Next, we used in vitro reconstitution experiments to find a possible molecular mechanism. We show that anillin promotes contraction by increasing myosin processivity and dwell time on actin fibers. More work is needed to uncover the purpose of this anillin-enhanced actomyosin contraction and to verify anillin's direct involvement in cells. Nevertheless, we are presenting a completely new role for a canonically cytokinetic scaffolding protein.","The research was supported by Czech Science Foundation Grant No. 19-27477X.","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","","","","","","","","Štěpánka Tomášová","Alexander Beber","Pavlína Šliková","Lenka Libusová ","Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Development, Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University","Laboratory of Structural Proteins, Institute of Biotechnology, Czech Academy of Sciences","AF 1","AF 2","AF 2","AF 1","Author 1","Yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2023/05/26 10:36:45 dop. GMT+3","bujak@ufe.cz","Ultrafast Tracking of Microtubule-Associated Proteins: Unveiling Stochastic Motion and Interactions at Unprecedented Spatiotemporal Resolution using iSCAT Microscopy","Recent advancements in fluorescence-based microscopy techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and nanoscopic tracking, have catalyzed the study of biological processes with a detail and precision that were previously unattainable. Offering spatial resolutions below 10 nm and temporal resolutions in the millisecond range, these techniques have opened up new research avenues but there remains an urgent need to extend the limits of spatiotemporal resolution even further.
To tackle this challenge, we employed interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), a method which has demonstrated high sensitivity for detecting small scattering nanoparticles and unlabeled single proteins, with sub-nanometer spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolutions [1-3]. Coupling iSCAT with a high frame rate camera and a novel labeling method, we successfully tracked the motion of two specific proteins, anaphase spindle elongation protein 1 (ASE1) and tubulin-associated Tau, on a microtubule lattice.
Achieving an unprecedented spatial resolution of better than 2 nm and 5 nm, and a temporal resolution as low as 22 µs and 1 µs respectively for ASE1 and Tau proteins, we were able to reveal novel insights into their three-dimensional motion and interactions with the microtubule lattice. We discovered that the movement of these proteins is not linear along a microtubule protofilament, but rather features a stochastic pattern.
From these observations, we were able to distinguish between different diffusion characteristics of the axial and perpendicular motion of both ASE1 and Tau proteins. The analysis of this motion exposed clear statistical signatures of confined motion, and we were able to detect sub-millisecond confinements in the trajectories, matching the periodicity corresponding to the size of a single tubulin dimer.
This high-fidelity ultrafast tracking technique enabled us to shed new light on the unknown choreography and mechanisms of diffusive motion of microtubule-associated proteins, as well as their interactions with the microtubule lattice. Our findings suggest a new understanding of these processes and may hold significant implications for the study of other biological systems. These advancements in our comprehension represent a considerable progression in the study of biological processes at the molecular scale, emphasizing the utility of iSCAT in gaining insights into intricate cellular mechanisms.

ATP decrease is related to ageing and neurodegeneration. In many neurodegenerative diseases, the neuronal, microtubule associated protein tau, which can cooperatively assemble into a cohesive layer termed microtubule envelope, dissociates from microtubules and the microtubules disintegrate. Mechanisms leading to tau dissociation from microtubules are, however, unclear. Here we show that ATP depletion causes disassembly of protective tau envelopes from microtubules. Using reconstitution experiments, live-cell imaging, and molecular modeling, we found that microtubule-associated ATP stabilizes tau molecules on the microtubule surface, enhancing thus the envelope self-assembly. We show that decrease in ATP level can lead to destabilization of tau envelope and microtubule disintegration through microtubule severing enzymes. Our results thus introduce microtubule-associated ATP as a modulator of function of MAPs and provide an unexpected link between two canonical neuro-pathological factors, ATP decrease and tau.","","More than 10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(1) Institute of Biotechnology, Czech Academy of Sciences, BIOCEV, Prague

The functioning and interactions of proteins, including those in the cytoskeleton, are greatly influenced by the electric charge present on the amino acid residues and atomic groups within them. Consequently, the application of an external electric field offers a promising approach to manipulate the functionality of cytoskeletal proteins. In this talk , we present a bottom-up methodology aimed at comprehending the impact of intense pulsed electric fields (PEFs) on the fundamental biomolecular components of the cytoskeleton, progressing from computational simulations (in silico) to experiments on isolated proteins (in vitro) and ultimately to investigations conducted within living cells (in vivo).
Initially, we provide insights into the effects of nanosecond PEFs on tubulin and microtubules through molecular dynamics simulations [1, 2]. By utilizing these insights, we are able to interpret our findings regarding the ability of nanosecond PEFs to influence the conformation of tubulin and thereby control the self-assembly of tubulin into microtubule structures in vitro [3]. Subsequently, we demonstrate how the combination of chip microfabrication technology and advanced microscopy has equipped us with the necessary tools to observe the effects of nanosecond PEFs on the cytoskeletal network within living cells [4, 5].

In contrast to the tips, the microtubule lattice was long considered to be static. The discovery of subunit loss and incorporation along the lattice far from the tips – termed lattice dynamics – led to a paradigm shift and revealed a new dimension of microtubule dynamics. 
Microtubule lattice dynamics occur in vitro as well as in living cells and contribute to microtubule organization and resilience to mechanical stress. Nevertheless, many aspects of microtubule lattice dynamics are yet to be fully elucidated, particularly regarding the cellular mechanisms and molecular players involved in their regulation. Here, we explore the phenomenon of microtubule lattice dynamics, its contribution to microtubule self-repair, its relation to microtubule tip dynamics, and its regulation by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), including our recent findings on tau protein.
